            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Over the past 20 years, there have been many alarmin claims about the risks of vaccinations which make vaccinations seem like a big risk to take. However, what we, as humans perceive to be a big risk, may not always be accurate.This, due to flawed studies as well as rumors based on those flawed studies. For example, 1 out of 10 Americans have a fear of zombies, which do not exist but exist in the mind of these people, due to theories and rumors. On this website, you can find information about vaccinations, based on scientific research and facts not opinions. </p>

            <h1>Myths and misconceptions</h1>
            <div class="misconceptions" id="m0"><p><h3>Why do people not vaccinate their children?</h3></br>There are several reasons why some parents have decided not to vaccinate their children. The greatest reason is safety concerns, most of which are based on information the parents have received from the media or acquaintances. Religious and philosophical reasons are generally linked to the core beliefs of the parents. One last possible reason is that the parents have limited access to vaccinations due to living in below average conditions.

            <div class="misconceptions" id="m1"><p><h3>Overloaded immune system</h3></br>
            The belief that a child’s immune system can become overloaded if they are given multiple vaccines appeared when the childhood immunization schedule was expanded to include more vaccines, and when several vaccines were combined into one shot only. Several studies have shown that vaccines have the same likelihood to cause harmful effects when several are given at once compared to when they are given separately. Children are also constantly exposed to foreign antigens everyday, from sources such as food, air, and water. </p>
</div>      <div class="misconceptions" id="m2"><p><h3>Vaccines contain toxic substances</h3></br>Some vaccines contain mercury, formaldehyde, and aluminium, which are known toxic substances. 
Mercury has been used as a preservative in vaccines since the 1930s, and is now only found in the flu vaccine. Large amounts of mercury can be harmful, resulting in neurological and behavioral disorders. We ingest mercury on a daily basis, it is found in seafood and water, and babies are exposed to mercury in milk (including breast milk). 
The type of mercury found in vaccines is ethylmercury, which the body breaks down and excretes it faster than methylmercury. No study has found a link between ethylmercury and autism. 

Formaldehyde is used to inactivate viruses. It is classed as a carcinogen (causes cancer) by the US EPA, and is commonly found in household products, paint and felt tip markers. The FDA states that there is 50 - 70 times more formaldehyde in a newborn baby’s body than in a dose of a vaccine, so there are no negative effects on the body due to the formaldehyde present in vaccines.

Aluminium is not present in all vaccines. It is used to strengthen immune response, which makes the vaccine is more effective. There is evidence that long term exposure to high levels of aluminium can contribute to diseases of the bones and brain. The average person intakes 30 - 50 mg of aluminium each day, mainly from food and water. Vaccines however, have 0.125 to 0.625 mg of aluminium per dose, roughly 1% of the average daily intake.

            <div class="misconceptions" id="m3"><p><h3>Vaccines cause autism</h3></br>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder caused by differences in how the brain functions. This results in different ways of communication, social interaction, learning. Currently, there is a concern amongst parents that giving vaccines of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines could cause autism. Another reason for this concern is the fact that cases of autism increased over the past 20 years. If the theory that this increase in autism would be caused by the MMR vaccine, then the amounts of this vaccine given would have increased too, if this were the cause.
</br></br>The first study that suggests this is a study done in 1998, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in the journal Lancet. Wakefield's hypothesis (what he expected to obtain from the experiment) was that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine would cause intenstinal inflammation which would then give out a mysterious type of protein that would enter the brain and cause autism. In support of his hypothesis, Dr. Wakefield described 12 children with developmental delay — eight had autism. The parents of these children thought that the autism was the fault of the MMR vaccine these children had received. All of these children had intestinal complaints and developed autism within one month of receiving MMR. The effect of Wakefield’s study was an outbreak of measles in the United Kingdom.
</br></br>However, this study has been declared to be incorrect and is flawed for two reasons:</br>
        <ol>
            <li>Eight of children that said to have developed autism as a result of the injection, already had autism before getting the vaccine and before getting the gut symptoms. Therefore, this goes against this theory which stated that the intestinal inflammation would cause a protein causing autism, not the other way around.</li>
            <li>The mystery protein that would cause autism that was sent from the intestinal inflammation to the brain was never identified by any other piece of research.</li>

        </ol></br>Wakefield’s study was repeated by other scientists and several major studies were conducted looking further into Wakefield’s results, and none of them found a link between autism and vaccines. Recent research has shown that autism develops in the uterus, way before the child receives any vaccines.

        <div class="misconceptions" id="m4"><p><h3>Natural immunity is better than immunity achieved through vaccinations</h3>Is is a fact that an improved hygiene and nutrition, among other factors, can to an extend, lower the incidence of some diseases. However, out of data documenting the number of cases of a disease before and after the introduction of a vaccine are responsible for a large drop in disease rates. In some cases immunity caused by getting a disease lasts longer and is stronger than vaccine-acquired immunity However, this mindset has dangers of that may outweigh the benefits. Eg. for measles, there is a 1 in 500 chance of not surviving, with the vaccine there is a 1 in 1 million chance of having a severe allergic reaction to it.

</br></br>Secondly, by taking a vaccination, the chance of others getting the disease is significantly decreased. Taking the cases of measles as an example, between 1950 and 1963 the cases of measles in the United States raised from 300,000 to 800,000 cases a year. In order to protect themselves and their families from the disease, there must have been a lot of people that tried washing their hands more often. Between 1950 and 1963, the measles vaccine was introduced, by 1965, the cases of measles in the United States had dropped by 97,25%, to a number of 22.000 cases per year. By 1998, the number of cases per year is 100 or less, giving a percentage decrease of 99.99%
